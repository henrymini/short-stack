tried of losing track of thousands of your men over long campaigns in the endless march for the glory of rome?? worry no longer!!

For this project, I used almost entirely Ruby on Rails. I used atom as a text editor and heroku as cloud host for my back end.

I started this project by scaffolding the main resources, and then proceeded to test each aspect with curl scripts. I then set my controller to inherit from OpenRead and moved on to the user resource.

I hope in the future to be able to return to this project and add more functionality. I would like to potentially add a unit resource that belongs to a general and a user. If I could get that to work, I might add larger legions of units to a generals possession.
